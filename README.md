By first, use "make" so the proyect will compile. Then just "./minishell" and the promp will become like: "ðŸ‘Š minihostiasðŸ‘Š". This is a joke, in spanish has a lot of sense.
This proyect can: 
- execute commands.
- do pipes.
- signals are registered (use "echo $?").
- it has global variables (use "export" and "unset")
- storage the commands history when you press up/down arrow.
- it can do redirecctions as well.
